# MyVector_Data_Structure
basic hardcoded data structure
MyVecotor operates simular to an ArrayList
Add methods can add a object at the end of the myList Array, and can increase the capacity of the array if no space.
Add index can set a objects index to a parameter.
Includes isEmpty, which checks to see if it is an empty array
Clear removes all objects in the array by setting them to null
Includes get methods for the current capacity and increment to help the unit tests run properly
Size doesn't return the length of the array but rather the number of objects that aren't null
trimToSize sets the array to only the objects that aren't null
These methods can all be found in the ArrayList data structure, but these are hardcoded.
You can use my vector the same way you use and array list, by creating an instance of it and specifing the specific object.
Included my test class application, where I tested some of the methods.
